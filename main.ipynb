      "rate, the liquid height will rise until it reaches a height for which the output flow rate matches\n",
      "the input flow rate.Aself-regulating system does not provide regulation of a variable to any\n",

      "sponse to errors. This section discusses some methods for evaluating how well the system\n",
      "is working.\n",
      "The variable used to measure the performance of the control system is the error, \n",

      "trolled variable, c(t).\n",
      "   (1)\n",
      "Since the value of the controlled variable may vary in time, so may the error. (Note that in\n",
      "a servomechanism, the value of r may be forced to vary in time also.)\n",
      "Control System Objective\n",
      "In principle, the objective of a control system is to \n",
      "make the error in Equation (1) exactly zero, but the control system responds only to errors (i.e., \n",
      "when an error occurs, the control system takes action to drive it to zero). Conversely, if the \n",
      "error were zero and stayed zero, the control system would not be doing anything and would \n",
      "not be needed in the first place. Therefore, this objective can never be perfectly achieved, \n",
      "and there will always be some error. The question of evaluation becomes one of how large \n",
      "the error is and how it varies in time.\n",
      "A practical statement of control system objective is best represented by three \n",
      "requirements:\n",
      "1. The system should be stable.\n",
      "2. The system should provide the best possible steady-state regulation.\n",
      "3. The system should provide the best possible transient regulation.\n",
      "4.1 Stability\n",
      "The purpose of the control system is to regulate the value of some variable. This requires \n",
      "that action be taken on the process itself in response to a measurement of the variable. If \n",
      "this is not done correctly, the control system can cause the process to become unstable. \n",
      "In fact, the more tightly we try to control the variable, the greater the possibility of \n",
      "instability.\n",
      "Figure 7 shows that, prior to turning on a control system, the controlled variable drifts \n",
      "in a random fashion and is not regulated. After the control system is turned on, the variable \n",
      "is forced to adopt the setpoint value, and all is well for awhile. Notice that some time later, however, \n",

      "even though the control system is still connected and operational; in fact, it occurs because \n",

      "2 PRINCIPLES OF ANALOG SIGNAL CONDITIONING\n",
      "A sensor measures a variable by converting information about that variable into a depen-\n",
      "dent signal of either electrical or pneumatic nature. To develop such transducers, we take\n",
      "advantage of fortuitous circumstances in nature where a dynamic variable influences some\n",
      "characteristic of a material. Consequently, there is little choice of the type or extent of such\n",
      "proportionality. For example, once we have researched nature and found that cadmium sul-\n",
      "fide resistance varies inversely and nonlinearly with light intensity, we must then learn to\n",
      "employ this device for light measurement within the confines of that dependence. Analog\n",
      "signal conditioning provides the operations necessary to transform a sensor output into a\n",
      "form necessary to interface with other elements of the process-control loop. We will con-\n",
      "fine our attention to electrical transformations.\n",
      "We often describe the effect of the signal conditioning by the term transfer function. \n",
      "By this term we mean the effect of the signal conditioning on the input signal. Thus, a sim-\n",
      "ple voltage amplifier has a transfer function of some constant that, when multiplied by the\n",
      "input voltage, gives the output voltage.\n",
      "It is possible to categorize signal conditioning into several general types.\n",
      "2.1 Signal-Level and Bias Changes\n",
      "One of the most common types of signal conditioning involves adjusting the level (magni-\n",
      "tude) and bias (zero value) of some voltage representing a process variable. For example,\n",
      "some sensor output voltage may vary from 0.2 to 0.6 V as a process variable changes over\n",
      "a measurement range. However, equipment to which this sensor output must be connected\n",
      "perhaps requires a voltage that varies from 0 to 5 V for the same variation of the process \n",
      "variable.\n",
      "We perform the required signal conditioning by first changing the zero to occur when\n",
      "the sensor output is 0.2 V. This can be done by simply subtracting 0.2 from the sensor out-\n",
      "put, which is called a zero shift, or a bias adjustment.\n",
      "Now we have a voltage that varies from 0 to 0.4 V, so we need to make the voltage\n",
      "larger. If we multiply the voltage by 12.5, the new output will vary from 0 to 5 V as re-\n",
      "quired. This is called amplification, and 12.5 is called the gain. In some cases, we need to \n",
      "make a sensor output smaller, which is called attenuation. You should note that the circuit \n",
      "that does either chore is called an amplifier. We  distinguish between amplification and at-\n",
      "tenuation by noting whether the gain of the amplifier is greater than or less than unity.\n",
      "In designing bias and amplifier circuits, we must be concerned with issues such as the\n",
      "frequency response, output impedance, and input impedance.\n",
      "2.2 Linearization\n",
      "As pointed out at the beginning of this section, the process-control designer has little choice \n",
      "of the characteristics of a sensor output versus a process variable. Often, the dependence \n",
      "that exists between input and output is nonlinear. Even those devices that are approximately\n",
      "linear may present problems when precise measurements of the variable are required.\n",
      "ANALOG SIGNAL CONDITIONING\n",
      "56\n",
      "\n",
      "FIGURE 1\n",
      "The purpose of linearization is to provide an\n",
      "output that varies linearly with some vari-\n",
      "able even if the sensor output does not.\n",
      "Historically, specialized analog circuits were devised to linearize signals. For exam-\n",
      "ple, suppose a sensor output varied nonlinearly with a process variable, as shown in Figure \n",
      "1a. A linearization circuit, indicated symbolically in Figure 1b, would ideally be one \n",
      "that conditioned the sensor output so that a voltage was produced which was linear with the \n",
      "process variable, as shown in Figure 1c. Such circuits are difficult to design and usually \n",
      "operate only within narrow limits.\n",
      "The modern approach to this problem is to provide the nonlinear signal as input to a\n",
      "computer and perform the linearization using software. Virtually any nonlinearity can be\n",
      "handled in this manner and, with the speed of modern computers, in nearly real time.\n",
      "2.3 Conversions\n",
      "Often, signal conditioning is used to convert one type of electrical variation into another.\n",

      "a. Very small values of resistance are to be avoided because they can lead to\n",
      "large currents, and thus large loading effects. Similarly, very large\n",
      "capacitance should be avoided. In general, we try to keep the resistance in\n",
      "the \n",
      "and above range and capacitors in the \n",
      "or less range.\n",
      "b. Often, the exact critical frequency is not important, so that fixed resistors\n",
      "and capacitors of approximately the computed values can be employed. If\n",
      "exact values are necessary, it is usually easier to select and measure a\n",
      "capacitor, then compute and obtain the appropriate resistance using a\n",
      "trimmer resistance.\n",
      "2. The effective input impedance and output impedance of the RC filter may have\n",
      "an effect on the circuit in which it is used because of loading effects. If the input \n",
      "impedance of the circuit being fed by the filter is low, you may want to place a \n",

      "SUMMARY\n",
      "1. The measurement and control of temperature plays an important role in the process-\n",
      "control industry. The class of sensors that performs this measurement consists primarily\n",
      "of three types: (1) the resistance-temperature detector (RTD), (2) the thermistor, and\n",
      "(3) the thermocouple. In this chapter, the basic operating principles and application in-\n",
      "formation have been provided for these sensors. Several other sensors have been briefly\n",
      "described.\n",
      "2. The concept of temperature is contained in the representation of a body‚Äôs thermal en-\n",
      "ergy as the average thermal energy per molecule, expressed in units of degrees of tem-\n",
      "perature. Four units of temperature are in common use. Two of these scales are called\n",
      "absolute, because an indication of zero units corresponds to zero thermal energy.\n",
      "These scales, which are designated by kelvin (K) and degrees Rankine \n",
      ", differ\n",
      "only in the amount of energy represented by each unit. The amount of energy repre-\n",
      "sented by 1 K corresponds to \n",
      ". Thus, we can transform temperatures using\n",
      "(1)\n",
      "3. The other two scales are called relative, because their zero does not occur at a zero of\n",
      "thermal energy. The Celsius scale \n",
      "corresponds in degree size to the kelvin, but\n",
      "has a shift of the zero so that\n",

      "and Rankine scales are related by\n",

      "5. The RTD is a sensor that depends on the increase in metallic resistance with tempera-\n",

      "press the resistance versus temperature as either a linear equation,\n",

      "(12)\n",
      "6. When a greater degree of accuracy is desired, tables or graphs of resistance versus tem-\n",

      "such as crushed material or powder, is carried by a conveyor belt system or by some other\n",
      "host material. For example, if solid material is suspended in a liquid host, the combination\n",

      "called stress. The strain gauge converts strain into a change of resistance.\n",
      "3. Accelerometers are used to measure the acceleration of objects because of rectilinear\n",
      "motion, vibration, and shock. Most of them operate by the spring-mass principle,\n",
      "which converts acceleration information into a displacement.\n",
      "4. Pressure is the force per unit area that a fluid exerts on the walls of a container. Pres-\n",
      "sure sensors often convert pressure information into a displacement. Examples include\n",
      "diaphragms, bellows, and the Bourdon tube. Electronic measures are often used for\n",
      "low pressures.\n",
      "5. For gas pressures less than 1 atm, purely electrical techniques are used. In some cases,\n",
      "the temperature of a heated wire is used to indicate pressure.\n",
      "6. Flow sensors are very important in the manufacturing world. Typically, solid flow is\n",
      "mass or weight per unit time.\n",

      "1. A discrete-state process is one for which the process variables can take on only two states.\n",
      "2. A discrete-state process-control system is one that causes the process to pass through a se-\n",
      "quence of events. Each event is described by a unique specification of the process variables.\n",
      "3. The hardware of the process must be carefully defined in terms of the nature of its two\n",
      "states and its relation to the process.\n",
      "4. The sequence of events can be described in narrative fashion, as a flowchart, or in\n",
      "terms of Boolean equations.\n",
      "5. Aladder diagram is a schematic way of describing the sequence of events of a discrete-\n",
      "state control system.\n",

      "control processes. In those processes, the operations and variables were in one of only \n",
      "two states: ON or OFF. In the present chapter, we consider the nature of controller ac-\n",
      "tion for systems with operations and variables that range over continuous values. The \n",
      "controller inputs the result of a measurement of the controlled variable and determines \n",
      "an appropriate output to the final control element. Essentially, the controller is some \n",
      "form of computer‚Äîeither analog or digital, pneumatic or electronic‚Äîthat, using input \n",
      "measurements, solves certain equations to calculate the proper output. The equations nec-\n",
      "essary to obtain control exist in only a few forms, independent of both the process itself and\n",

      "used and the value of certain constants in the mode equations. In this chapter, we will study \n",
      "the various modes of controller operation.\n",
      "2 PROCESS CHARACTERISTICS\n",
      "The selection of what controller modes to use in a process is a function of the characteris-\n",
      "tics of the process. It is not our intention to discuss how the modes are selected but to de-\n",
      "fine the meaning of each mode. At the same time, it is helpful in understanding the modes \n",
      "if certain pertinent characteristics of the process are considered. In this section, we will de-\n",
      "fine a few properties of processes that are important for selecting the proper modes.\n",
      "2.1 Process Equation\n",
      "A process-control loop regulates some dynamic variable in a process. This controlled vari-\n",
      "able, a process parameter, may depend on many other parameters (in the process) and thus \n",
      "suffer changes from many different sources. We have selected one of these other parame-\n",
      "ters to be our controlling parameter. If a measurement of the controlled variable shows a \n",
      "deviation from the setpoint, then the controlling parameter is changed, which in turn \n",
      "changes the controlled variable.\n",
      "As an example, consider the control of liquid temperature in a tank, as shown in\n",
      "Figure 1. The controlled variable is the liquid temperature, \n",
      ". This temperature depends\n",
      "on many parameters in the process‚Äîfor example, the input flow rate via pipe A, the out-\n",

      "perature,     , and the steam flow rate, \n",
      ". In this case, the steam flow rate is the controlling \n",
      "parameter chosen to provide control over the variable (liquid temperature). If one of the \n",
      "other parameters changes, a change in temperature results. To bring the temperature back \n",
      "to the setpoint value, we change only the steam flow rate‚Äîthat is, heat input to the process. \n",

      "Alarms\n",
      "One area where simple digital logic can be of practical and fiscal value is the implementa-\n",
      "tion of alarms. An alarm is defined as an on/off condition wherein a warning is issued when\n",
      "some process variable passes a critical value. For example, we may need an alarm when a\n",
      "pressure exceeds some limit or when a temperature falls below some limit. The alarm may\n",
      "do something as simple as turning on a warning light or something as sophisticated as is-\n",
      "suing a signal to a computer for corrective action.\n",
      "Single Variable\n",
      "The simplest alarms are those involving only a single variable.\n",
      "For this type of alarm a simple implementation is to convert the measurement signal to a\n",
      "voltage and use a digital comparator. In general we want to use a comparator with hystere-\n",
      "sis to avoid a staccato type of response wherein the comparator output switches between 1\n",

      "trigger within which no output transition occurs. This protects against noise on the signals\n",

      "An overview of the operational characteristics of the entire process-control loop includes\n",
      "the following points:\n",
      "1. Although the single-variable control loop is widely used in process control, we often\n",

      "or simply P&ID. The symbols and their meanings have been standardized in the industry\n",

      "Symbols and Identification, ANSI/ISA S5.1-1984 (R1992). This appendix presents an\n",

      "Figure 1 shows the line definitions. It is necessary to indicate on the P&ID the exact\n",
      "nature of these lines. For example, a dashed line represents an electric signal, but the P&ID\n",
      "would have to indicate the nature of the signal‚Äîfor example, a 4- to 20-mA current or a\n",
      "0 to 5-V voltage. In a similar fashion, it would be necessary to specify the nature of the\n",
      "data link‚Äîfor example, 10-Mb Ethernet LAN line or serial-bit stream.\n",
      "The solid line is primarily used to represent actual process product flow, often as a bold\n",
