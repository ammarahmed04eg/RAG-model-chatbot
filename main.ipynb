      "Preface to the Project Gutenburg Etext\n",
      "When Lionel Giles began his translation of Sun Tzu‚Äôs ART OF WAR, the work was\n",
      "virtually unknown in Europe. Its introduction to Europe began in 1782 when a French\n",
      "Jesuit Father living in China, Joseph Amiot, acquired a copy of it, and translated it into\n",
      "French. It was not a good translation because, according to Dr. Giles, \"[I]t contains a\n",
      "great deal that Sun Tzu did not write, and very little indeed of what he did.\"\n",
      "The Ô¨Årst translation into English was published in 1905 in Tokyo by Capt. E. F.\n",
      "Calthrop, R.F.A. However, this translation is, in the words of Dr. Giles, \"excessively\n",

      "passages were willfully distorted or slurred over. Such offenses are less pardonable.\n",
      "They would not be tolerated in any edition of a Latin or Greek classic, and a similar\n",

      "a new edition of Capt. Calthrop‚Äôs translation was published in London. It was an im-\n",
      "provement on the Ô¨Årst ‚Äì omissions Ô¨Ålled up and numerous mistakes corrected ‚Äì but\n",
      "new errors were created in the process. Dr. Giles, in justifying his translation, wrote:\n",
      "\"It was not undertaken out of any inÔ¨Çated estimate of my own powers; but I could not\n",
      "help feeling that Sun Tzu deserved a better fate than had befallen him, and I knew that,\n",
      "at any rate, I could hardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors.\"\n",
      "Clearly, Dr. Giles‚Äô work established much of the groundwork for the work of later\n",
      "translators who published their own editions. Of the later editions of the ART OF WAR\n",
      "I have examined; two feature Giles‚Äô edited translation and notes, the other two present\n",
      "the same basic information from the ancient Chinese commentators found in the Giles\n",
      "edition. Of these four, Giles‚Äô 1910 edition is the most scholarly and presents the reader\n",
      "an incredible amount of information concerning Sun Tzu‚Äôs text, much more than any\n",
      "other translation.\n",
      "The Giles‚Äô edition of the ART OF WAR, as stated above, was a scholarly work.\n",
      "Dr. Giles was a leading sinologue at the time and an assistant in the Department of\n",
      "Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts in the British Museum. Apparently he wanted\n",
      "to produce a deÔ¨Ånitive edition, superior to anything else that existed and perhaps some-\n",
      "thing that would become a standard translation. It was the best translation available for\n",
      "50 years. But apparently there was not much interest in Sun Tzu in English- speaking\n",
      "countries since it took the start of the Second World War to renew interest in his work.\n",
      "Several people published unsatisfactory English translations of Sun Tzu. In 1944, Dr.\n",

      "science books. But it wasn‚Äôt until 1963 that a good English translation (by Samuel B.\n",

      "Sun Tzu Wu was a native of the Ch‚Äòi State. His ART OF WAR brought\n",
      "him to the notice of Ho Lu,2 King of Wu.\n",
      "Ho Lu said to him: \"I have carefully perused your 13 chapters. May I\n",
      "submit your theory of managing soldiers to a slight test?\"\n",
      "Sun Tzu replied: \"You may.\"\n",
      "Ho Lu asked: \"May the test be applied to women?\"\n",
      "The answer was again in the afÔ¨Årmative, so arrangements were made to\n",
      "bring 180 ladies out of the Palace. Sun Tzu divided them into two com-\n",
      "panies, and placed one of the King‚Äôs favorite concubines at the head of\n",
      "each. He then bade them all take spears in their hands, and addressed\n",
      "them thus: \"I presume you know the difference between front and back,\n",
      "right hand and left hand?\"\n",
      "The girls replied: Yes.\n",
      "Sun Tzu went on: \"When I say \"Eyes front,\" you must look straight ahead.\n",
      "When I say \"Left turn,\" you must face towards your left hand. When I say\n",
      "\"Right turn,\" you must face towards your right hand. When I say \"About\n",
      "turn,\" you must face right round towards your back.\"\n",
      "Again the girls assented. The words of command having been thus ex-\n",
      "plained, he set up the halberds and battle-axes in order to begin the drill.\n",
      "Then, to the sound of drums, he gave the order \"Right turn.\" But the girls\n",
      "only burst out laughing. Sun Tzu said: \"If words of command are not clear\n",
      "and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, then the general is to\n",
      "blame.\"\n",

      "So he started drilling them again, and this time gave the order \"Left turn,\"\n",
      "whereupon the girls once more burst into Ô¨Åts of laughter. Sun Tzu: \"If\n",
      "words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly\n",
      "understood, the general is to blame. But if his orders ARE clear, and the\n",
      "soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their ofÔ¨Åcers.\"\n",
      "So saying, he ordered the leaders of the two companies to be beheaded.\n",
      "Now the king of Wu was watching the scene from the top of a raised\n",
      "pavilion; and when he saw that his favorite concubines were about to be\n",
      "executed, he was greatly alarmed and hurriedly sent down the following\n",
      "message: \"We are now quite satisÔ¨Åed as to our general‚Äôs ability to handle\n",
      "troops. If We are bereft of these two concubines, our meat and drink will\n",
      "lose their savor. It is our wish that they shall not be beheaded.\"\n",
      "Sun Tzu replied: \"Having once received His Majesty‚Äôs commission to\n",
      "be the general of his forces, there are certain commands of His Majesty\n",
      "which, acting in that capacity, I am unable to accept.\"\n",
      "Accordingly, he had the two leaders beheaded, and straightway installed\n",
      "the pair next in order as leaders in their place. When this had been done,\n",
      "the drum was sounded for the drill once more; and the girls went through\n",
      "all the evolutions, turning to the right or to the left, marching ahead or\n",
      "wheeling back, kneeling or standing, with perfect accuracy and precision,\n",
      "not venturing to utter a sound. Then Sun Tzu sent a messenger to the King\n",
      "saying: \"Your soldiers, Sire, are now properly drilled and disciplined, and\n",
      "ready for your majesty‚Äôs inspection. They can be put to any use that their\n",
      "sovereign may desire; bid them go through Ô¨Åre and water, and they will\n",
      "not disobey.\"\n",
      "But the King replied: \"Let our general cease drilling and return to camp.\n",
      "As for us, We have no wish to come down and inspect the troops.\"\n",
      "Thereupon Sun Tzu said: \"The King is only fond of words, and cannot\n",
      "translate them into deeds.\"\n",
      "After that, Ho Lu saw that Sun Tzu was one who knew how to handle an\n",
      "army, and Ô¨Ånally appointed him general. In the west, he defeated the Ch‚Äòu\n",
      "State and forced his way into Ying, the capital; to the north he put fear\n",

      "About Sun Tzu himself this is all that Ssu-ma Ch‚Äòien has to tell us in this chapter. But\n",
