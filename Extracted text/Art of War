henderson tells us wellington great many milit ary qualities especially distinguished extraordinary skill concealed movements deceived friend foe . 19. hence able attack must seem unable using forces must seem inactive near must make enemy lieve far away far away must make believe near . 20. hold baits entice enemy . feign disorder crush . commentators except chang yu say disorder crush . natural suppose sun tzu still illustrating uses deception war . 21. secure points prepared . superior strength evade . 22. opponent choleric temper seek irritate . pretend weak may grow arrogant . wang tzu quoted tu yu says good tactician plays adversary cat plays mouse rst feigning weakness immob ility suddenly pouncing upon . 23. taking ease give rest . probably meaning though mei yaochen note taking ease wait enemy tire . yu lan lure tire . forces united separate . less plausible interpretation favored commentators sovereign subject accord put division . 24. attack unprepared appear expected . 25. military devices leading victory must divulged hand . 26. general wins battle makes many calculations temple ere battle fought . chang yu tells us ancient times customary temple set apart use general take eld order might elaborate plan campaign . general loses battle makes calculations beforehand . thus many calculations lead victory calculations defeat much calcu lation ! attention point foresee likely win lose . chapter 3 waging war tsao kung note wishes ght must rst count cost prepares us discovery subject chapter might expect title primarily consideration ways means . 1. sun tzu said operations war eld thou sand swift chariots many heavy chariots hundred thousand mail clad soldiers swift chariots lightly built according chang yu used attack heavy chariots heavier designed pur poses defense . li chuan true says latter light seems hardly probable . interesting note analogies early chinese warfare homeric greeks . case war chariot important factor forming nucleus round grouped certain number footsoldiers . regard numbers given informed swift chariot accom panied 75 footmen heavy chariot 25 footmen whole army would divided thousand battalions consist ing two chariots hundred men . provisions enough carry thousand li 2.78 modern li go mile . length may varied slightly since sun tzus time . expenditure home front including entertainment guests small items glue paint sums spent chariots armor reach total thousand ounces silver per day . cost raising army 100000 men . 2. engage actual ghting victory long coming mens weapons grow dull ardor damped . lay siege town exhaust strength . 33 chapter 3. waging war 34 3. campaign protracted resources state equal strain . 4. weapons dulled ardor damped strength exhausted treasure spent chieftains spring take advantage extremity . man however wise able avert consequences must ensue . 5. thus though heard stupid haste war cleverness never seen associated long delays . concise difcult sentence well explained commentators . tsao kung li chuan meng shih tu yu tu mu mei yaochen notes effect general though naturally stupid may nevertheless conquer sheer force rapidity . ho shih says haste may stupid rate saves expenditure energy treasure protracted operations may clever bring calamity train . wang hsi evades difculty remark ing lengthy operations mean army growing old wealth expen ded empty exchequer distress among people true cleverness insures occurrence calamities . chang yu says long victory attained stupid haste preferable clever dilat oriness . sun tzu says nothing whatever except possibly implic ation illconsidered haste better ingenious lengthy operations . say something much guarded namely speed may sometimes injudicious tardiness never anything foolish means impoverishment na tion . considering point raised sun tzu classic example fabius cunctator inevitably occur mind . general de liberately measured endurance rome hannibalss isolated army seemed latter likely suffer long campaign strange country . quite moot question whether tactics would proved successful long run . reversal true led cannae establishes negative presumption favor . 6. instance country beneted prolonged warfare . 7. one thoroughly acquainted evils war thoroughly understand protable way carrying . rapidity . one knows disastrous effects long war realize supreme importance rapidity bringing close . two commentators seem favor interpretation ts well logic context whereas rendering know evils war appreciate benets distinctly pointless . chapter 3. waging war 35 8. skillful soldier raise second levy neither supply wagons loaded twice . war declared waste precious time waiting rein forcements return army back fresh supplies crosses enemys frontier without delay . may seem audacious policy recommend great strategists julius caesar napoleon bonaparte value time little ahead oppon ent counted either numerical superiority nicest calculations regard commissariat . 9. bring war material home forage enemy . thus army food enough needs . chinese word translated war material literally means things used meant widest sense . includes impedi menta army apart provisions . 10. poverty state exchequer causes army maintained con tributions distance . contributing maintain army distance causes people impoverished . beginning sentence balance properly next though obviously intended . arrangement moreover awkward help suspecting corruption text . never seems occur chinese commentators emendation may ne cessary sense get help . chinese words sun tzu used indicate cause peoples impoverishment clearly reference system husbandmen sent contributions corn army direct . fall maintain army way except state government poor ? 11. hand proximity army causes prices go high prices cause peoples substance drained away . wang hsi says high prices occur army left territory . tsao kung understands army already crossed frontier . 12. substance drained away peasantry aficted heavy exactions . 13.14. loss substance exhaustion strength homes people stripped bare threetenths income dis sipated tu mu wang hsi agree people mulcted 310 710 income . hardly extracted text . ho shih characteristic tag people regarded chapter 3. waging war 36 essential part state food peoples heaven right authority value careful ? government expenses broken chariots wornout horses breast plates helmets bows arrows spears shields protective mantles draughtoxen heavy wagons amount fourtenths total rev enue . 15. hence wise general makes point foraging enemy . one cart load enemys provisions equivalent twenty ones likewise single picul provender equivalent twenty ones store . twenty cartloads consumed process transporting one cartload front . picul unit measure equal 133.3 pounds 65.5 kilograms . 16. order kill enemy men must roused anger may advantage defeating enemy must rewards . tu mu says rewards necessary order make soldiers see advantage beating enemy thus capture spoils enemy must used rewards men may keen desire ght account . 17. therefore chariot ghting ten chariots taken rewarded took rst . ags substituted enemy chariots mingled used conjunction . captured soldiers kindly treated kept . 18. called using conquered foe augment ones strength . 19. war let great object victory lengthy campaigns . ho shih remarks war thing tried . sun tzu reiterates main lesson chapter intended enforce . 20. thus may known leader armies arbiter peoples fate man depends whether nation shall peace peril . chapter 4 attack stratagem 1. sun tzu said practical art war best thing take enemys country whole intact shatter destroy good . better recapture army entire destroy capture regiment detachment company entire destroy . equivalent army corps according ssuma fa consisted nom inally 12500 men according tsao kung equivalent regi ment contained 500 men equivalent detachment consists number 100 500 equivalent company contains 5 100 men . last two however chang yu gives exact gures 100 5 respectively . 2. hence ght conquer battles supreme excellence supreme excellence consists breaking enemys resistance without ghting . modern strategist approve words old chinese general . moltkes greatest triumph capitulation huge french army sedan practically without bloodshed . 3. thus highest form generalship balk enemys plans perhaps word balk falls short expressing full force chinese word implies attitude defense whereby one might content foil enemys stratagems one another active policy counter attack . ho shih puts clearly note enemy made plan attack us must anticipate delivering attack rst . next best prevent junction enemys forces isolating allies . must forget sun tzu speak ing hostilities always mind numerous states principalities china day split . 37 chapter 4. attack stratagem 38 next order attack enemys army eld already full strength . worst policy besiege walled cities . 4. rule besiege walled cities possibly avoided . another sound piece military theory . boers acted upon 1899 refrained dissipating strength kimberley mafeking even ladysmith probable would masters situation british ready seriously oppose . preparation mantlets movable shelters various implements war take three whole months quite clear chinese word translated mantlets described . tsao kung simply denes large shields get better idea li chuan says protect heads assaulting city walls close quarters . seems suggest sort roman testudo ready made . tu mu says wheeled vehicles used repelling attacks denied chen hao . see supra ii . 14. name also applied turrets city walls . movable shelters get fairly clear description several commentators . wooden missileproof structures four wheels propelled within covered raw hides used sieges convey parties men walls purpose lling encircling moat earth . tu mu adds called wooden donkeys . piling mounds walls take three months . great mounds ramparts earth heaped level enemys walls order discover weak points defense also destroy fortied turrets mentioned preceding note . 5. general unable control irritation launch men assault like swarming ants vivid simile tsao kung taken spectacle army ants climbing wall . meaning general losing patience long delay may make premature attempt storm place engines war ready . result onethird men slain town still remains untaken . disastrous effects siege . chapter 4. attack stratagem 39 reminded terrible losses japanese port arthur recent siege history record . 6. therefore skillful leader subdues enemys troops without ght ing captures cities without laying siege overthrows kingdom without lengthy operations eld . chia lin notes overthrows government harm individuals . classical instance wu wang put end yin dynasty acclaimed father mother people . 7. forces intact dispute mastery empire thus without losing man triumph complete . owing double meanings chinese text latter part sentence susceptible quite different meaning thus weapon blunted use keenness remains perfect . method attacking stratagem . 8. rule war forces ten enemys one surround one attack straightway without waiting advantage . twice numerous divide army two . tu mu takes exception saying rst sight indeed appears violate fundamental principle war . tsao kung however gives clue sun tzus meaning two enemys one may use one part army regular way special diversion . chang yu thus elucidates point force twice numerous enemy split two divisions one meet enemy front one fall upon rear replies frontal attack may crushed behind rearward attack may crushed front . meant saying one part may used regular way special diversion . tu mu understand dividing ones army simply irregular concentrating regular strategical method hasty calling mistake . 9. equally matched offer battle li chuan followed ho shih gives following paraphrase tackers attacked equally matched strength able general ght . slightly inferior numbers avoid enemy chapter 4. attack stratagem 40 meaning watch enemy certainly great improve ment unfortunately appears good authority variant . chang yu reminds us saying applies factors equal small difference numbers often counterbalanced superior energy discipline . quite unequal every way ee . 10. hence though obstinate ght may made small force end must captured larger force . 11. general bulwark state bulwark complete points state strong bulwark defective state weak . li chuan tersely puts gap indicates deciency generals ability perfect i.e . thoroughly versed profession army lack strength . 12. three ways ruler bring misfortune upon army 13 . 1 commanding army advance retreat ignorant fact obey . called hobbling army . li chuan adds comment like tying together legs thor oughbred unable gallop . one would naturally think ruler passage home trying direct movements army distance . commentators understand reverse quote saying tai kung kingdom governed without army directed within . course true engagement close touch enemy general thick troops little distance apart . otherwise liable misjudge position whole give wrong orders . 14 . 2 attempting govern army way administers kingdom ignorant conditions obtain army . causes restlessness soldiers minds . tsao kungs note freely translated military sphere civil sphere wholly distinct cant handle army kid gloves . chang yu says humanity justice principles govern state army opportunism exibility hand military rather civil virtues assimilate governing armyto state understood . 15 . 3 employing ofcers army without discrimination careful use right man right place . chapter 4. attack stratagem 41 ignorance military principle adaptation circumstances . shakes condence soldiers . follow mei yaochen . commentators refer ruler ss . 13 14 ofcers employs . thus tu yu says general ignorant principle adaptability must entrus ted position authority . tu mu quotes skillful employer men employ wise man brave man covetous man stupid man . wise man delights establishing merit brave man likes show courage action covetous man quick seizing advantages stupid man fear death . 16. army restless distrustful trouble sure come feudal princes . simply bringing anarchy army inging victory away . 17. thus may know essentials victory 1 win knows ght ght . chang yu says ght advances takes offensive ght retreats remains defensive . invari ably conquer knows whether right take offensive defensive . 2 win knows handle superior inferior forces . merely generals ability estimate numbers correctly li chuan others make . chang yu expounds saying sat isfactorily applying art war possible lesser force defeat greater vice versa . secret lies eye locality letting right moment slip . thus wu tzu says su perior force make easy ground inferior one make difcult ground . 3 win whose army animated spirit throughout ranks . 4 win prepared waits take enemy unpre pared . 5 win military capacity interfered sovereign . tu yu quotes wang tzu saying sovereigns function give broad instructions decide battle function general . needless dilate military disasters caused undue interference operations eld part home gov ernment . napoleon undoubtedly owed much extraordinary success fact hampered central authority . chapter 4. attack stratagem 42 18. hence saying know enemy know need fear result hundred battles . know enemy every victory gained also suffer defeat . li chuan cites case fu chien prince chin 383 a.d. marched vast army chin emperor . warned despise enemy could command services men hsieh huan chung boastfully replied population eight provinces back infantry horsemen number one million could dam yangtsze river merely throwing whips stream . danger fear ? nevertheless forces soon disastrously routed fei river obliged beat hasty retreat . know neither enemy succumb every battle . chang yu said knowing enemy enables take offensive knowing enables stand defensive . adds attack secret defense defense planning attack . would hard nd better epitome rootprinciple war . chapter 5 tactical dispositions tsao kung explains chinese meaning words title chapter marching countermarching part two armies view discov ering others condition . tu mu says dispositions army condition may discovered . conceal dispositions condition remain secret leads victory show dispositions condition become patent leads defeat . wang hsi remarks good general secure success modifying tactics meet enemy . 1. sun tzu said good ghters old rst put beyond possibility defeat waited opportunity defeating enemy . 2. secure defeat lies hands opportun ity defeating enemy provided enemy . course mistake enemys part . 3. thus good ghter able secure defeat chang yu says done concealing disposition troops covering tracks taking unremitting precautions . make certain defeating enemy . 4. hence saying one may know conquer without able . 5. security defeat implies defensive tactics ability defeat en emy means taking offensive . retain sense found similar passage ss . 13 spite fact commentators . meaning give conquer takes defensive plausible enough . 43 chapter 5. tactical dispositions 44 6. standing defensive indicates insufcient strength attacking su perabundance strength . 7. general skilled defense hides secret recesses earth literally hides ninth earth metaphor indicating utmost secrecy concealment enemy may know whereabouts . skilled attack ashes forth topmost heights heaven . another metaphor implying falls adversary like thunder bolt time prepare . opinion commentators . thus one hand ability protect victory complete . 8. see victory within ken common herd acme excellence . tsao kung remarks thing see plant germin ated foresee event action begun . li chuan alludes story han hsin attack vastly superior army chao strongly entrenched city chengan said ofcers gentlemen going annihilate enemy shall meet dinner . ofcers hardly took words seriously gave dubious assent . han hsin already worked mind details clever stratagem whereby foresaw able capture city inict crushing defeat adversary . 9. neither acme excellence ght conquer whole empire says well done ! true excellence tu mu says plan secretly move surrepti tiously foil enemys intentions balk schemes last day may without shedding drop blood . sun tzu reserves approbation things worlds coarse thumb nger fail plumb . 10. lift autumn hair sign great strength autumn hair explained fur hare nest au tumn begins grow afresh . phrase common one chinese writers . see sun moon sign sharp sight hear noise thunder sign quick ear . chapter 5. tactical dispositions 45 ho shih gives real instances strength sharp sight quick hearing wu huo could lift tripod weighing 250 stone li chu distance hundred paces could see objects bigger mustard seed shih kuang blind musician could hear footsteps mosquito . 11. ancients called clever ghter one wins excels winning ease . last half literally one conquering excels easy conquering . mei yaochen says sees obvious wins battles difculty looks surface things wins ease . 12. hence victories bring neither reputation wisdom credit courage . tu mu explains well inasmuch victories gained circumstances come light world large knows nothing wins reputation wisdom inasmuch hostile state submits bloodshed receives credit courage . 13. wins battles making mistakes . chen hao says plans superuous marches devises futile attacks . connection ideas thus explained chang yu one seeks conquer sheer strength clever though may win ning pitched battles also liable occasion vanquished whereas look future discern conditions yet manifest never make blunder therefore invariably win . making mistakes establishes certainty victory means conquering enemy already defeated . 14. hence skillful ghter puts position makes defeat impossible miss moment defeating enemy . counsel perfection tu mu truly observes . position need conned actual ground occupied troops . includes arrangements preparations wise general make increase safety army . 15. thus war victorious strategist seeks battle victory whereas destined defeat rst ghts afterwards looks victory . ho shih thus expounds paradox warfare rst lay plans ensure victory lead army battle begin stratagem rely brute strength alone victory longer assured . chapter 5. tactical dispositions 46 16. consummate leader cultivates moral law strictly adheres method discipline thus power control success . 17. respect military method rstly measurement secondly es timation quantity thirdly calculation fourthly balancing chances fthly victory . 18. measurement owes existence earth estimation quantity meas urement calculation estimation quantity balancing chances calculation victory balancing chances . easy distinguish four terms clearly chinese . rst seems surveying measurement ground enable us form estimate enemys strength make calculations based data thus obtained thus led general weighingup comparison enemys chances latter turn scale victory ensues . chief difculty lies third term chinese commentators take calculation numbers thereby making nearly synonymous second term . perhaps second term thought consideration enemys general position condition third term estimate numerical strength . hand tu mu says question relative strength settled bring varied resources cunning play . ho shih seconds interpretation weakens . however points third term calculation numbers . 19. victorious army opposed routed one pounds weight placed scale single grain . literally victorious army like 20 oz . weighed shu 124 oz . routed army shu weighed i. point simply enormous advantage
